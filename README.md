**A custom Team Fortress 2 gamemode that mixes Mann vs. Machine mechanics with regular gameplay.**

Mann vs. Mann was originally created by [Screwdriver](https://github.com/ScrewdriverHyena) and [Kenzzer](https://github.com/Kenzzer) in 2018 for the Red Sun Over Paradise community.
Development on it was ultimately stopped and the plugin was never released to the public.
