# Mann vs. Mann

**A custom Team Fortress 2 gamemode that puts Mann vs. Machine upgrades into regular gameplay.**

Mann vs. Mann was originally created by [Screwdriver](https://github.com/ScrewdriverHyena)
and [Kenzzer](https://github.com/Kenzzer) in 2018 for the Red Sun Over Paradise community. It was ultimately abandoned
and never publicly released due to countless issues.

In April 2021, [Mikusch](https://github.com/Mikusch) decided to completely rewrite the plugin from the ground up with
many needed fixes and additional gameplay elements.

## Features

- Working Mann vs. Machine mechanics in regular gameplay
    - Player and Item Upgrades
    - Power Up Canteens
    - Money Pickups
    - Buybacks
    - Revive Markers
    - ...and much more
- Compatible with arena mode and any map with resupply lockers
- Configurable using plugin ConVars

## Requirements

- SourceMod 1.10
- [DHooks with Detour Support](https://github.com/peace-maker/DHooks2/tree/dynhooks)
- [TF2Attributes](https://github.com/FlaminSarge/tf2attributes)
- [MemoryPatch](https://github.com/Kenzzer/MemoryPatch) (compile only)
